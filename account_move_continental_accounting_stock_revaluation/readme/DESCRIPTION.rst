Starting as Odoo 16 and as a result of important changes in the way Odoo handles stock accounting, it is no longer possible to reset to draft accounting journal entries that are related to stock valuation layers.
This module bypasses built-in restrictions and re-enables resetting to draft of continental accounting journal entries. Besides, it does adjust the stock valuation entries accordingly.
